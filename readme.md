Gravity Forms User Populate
===========================
This is a custom plugin for a client, utilizing a method mentioned in [this blog post](http://joshuadnelson.com/user-dropdown-list-custom-notification-routing-gravity-forms/).

*Use at your own risk*

**Note: Plugin requires wordpress to be installed in the main directory, not in a sub directory. If you place it in a subdirectory, add this to your wp-config.php file:

`define('GFUP_SUB_DIRECTORY', true );`
